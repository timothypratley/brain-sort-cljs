Comparing brain-sort with drag and drop sorting

## Overview

`brain-sort` introduced me to to idea that there might be a faster way to sort items
that require human comparision (for example prioritizing a TODO list).
See https://github.com/AdrianoFerrari/brain-sort

`brain-sort-cljs` puts a question based sorting implementation side by side with a
drag and drop sorting implementation, to allow for easier comparision of the two approaches.
